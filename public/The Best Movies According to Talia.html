 <h1>The Best Movies According to Talia </h1>
 <h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
 <hr>
 <ol>
    <li><b>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</b></li> I like this movie because it gives 
    me insight into a creative intepretation of what a romantic break up would look like 
    in a world of fantasy where we have the power to wrap time and perspective.
    <li><b>The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy </b></li> I like this movie because it features on of my favorite rappers, Mos Def 
    and it depcits a fantasy world where humans can change shapes and forms. I also like how humans collide with talking, animated creatures. 
    <li><b>Anything my son's dad recommends</b></li>...because his movie selections are always action packed, thought provoking, and witty. 
 </ol>
