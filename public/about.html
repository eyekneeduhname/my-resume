<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Talia, pronounced tuh-lee-yah and I am a web developer. I am also a mother of two boys under the age of six. 
  I have always been a creative person and have enjoyed using my creativity to navigate through life. 
  I have been fortunate enough to perform, model, record, paint, and play as a professional artist. But, with technology moving so fast
  and becoming more integrated into our lives, I decided to learn how to code. 
</p>

<p>I come across so many creative websites and platforms that solve a variety of problems. As a problem-solver myself, I like the idea of merging creativity with logic to create something that others can use to help them navigate life. 
  So, in 2018, I enrolled in a web development course at Harvard and began to code. 
  
</p>

<p>For now, I consider this a hobby. Like many of my creative pursuits, it is another thing that I do to reinforce one of my life's pillars, and that is to have fun!
